Welcome to CosmoSIS: Documentation Under Construction!
======================================================

Documentation Under Construction!

CosmoSIS is a **cosmological parameter estimation code**.  It is now at version 1.4.

It is a framework for structuring cosmological parameter estimation with a focus on flexibility, re-usability, debugging, verifiability, and code sharing in the form of calculation modules.

It consolidates and connects together existing code for predicting cosmic observables, and makes mapping out experimental likelihoods with a range of different techniques much more accessible

CosmoSIS is described in `Zuntz et al <http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3409>`_ - if you make use of it in your research, please cite that paper and include the URL of this repository in your acknowledgments. Thanks!
