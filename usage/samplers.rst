Samplers
--------

Samplers are the different methods that CosmoSIS uses to choose points in parameter spaces to evaluate.

Some are designed to actually explore likelihood spaces; others are useful for testing and understanding likelihoods.

Simple Samplers
===============

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

     test: Evaluate a single parameter set and save all results <../reference/samplers/test>
     list: Evaluate a pre-made list of parameter sets <../reference/samplers/list>


MCMC Samplers
===============

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

     emcee: Ensemble walker sampling <../reference/samplers/emcee>
     metropolis: Classic Metropolis-Hastings sampling <../reference/samplers/metropolis>
     importance: Importance sampling <../reference/samplers/importance>
     kombine: Clustered KDE <../reference/samplers/kombine>
     pmc: Adaptive Importance Sampling <../reference/samplers/pmc>
     pocoMC: Adaptive Importance Sampling <../reference/samplers/poco>

Nested Samplers
===============

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

     minuit sampler MPI-aware maxlike sampler from the ROOT package. <../reference/samplers/minuit>
     gridmax: Naive grid maximum-posterior <../reference/samplers/gridmax>


Grid Samplers
===============
