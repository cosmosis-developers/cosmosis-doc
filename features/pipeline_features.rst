Pipeline Features
==================


The Consistency module
----------------------

The CosmoSIS standard library has a particularly helpful module called ``consistency``, which is designed to translate automatically between different ways of expressing cosmological parameters.  

For example, if your values file specifies both :math:`\Omega_m` and :math:`h^2` then it will calculate :math:`\omega_m \equiv \Omega_m h^2` for you automatically.  

Any sufficient choice of the parameters can be specified and the remainder will be determined.
