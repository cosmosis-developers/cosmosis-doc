Command line flags for cosmosis-sample-fisher
---------------------------------------------

The :code:`cosmosis-sample-fisher` tool generates samples from a Fisher matrix produced by the CosmoSIS Fisher sampler.

You can view command line flags for cosmosis-sample-fisher using the command::

Purpose
=======

The Fisher sampler in CosmoSIS computes the Fisher information matrix, which provides an estimate of the parameter covariance matrix near the maximum likelihood point. The :code:`cosmosis-sample-fisher` tool uses this Fisher matrix to generate Gaussian samples that approximate the posterior distribution.

This is useful for:

* Quick parameter estimation when the posterior is approximately Gaussian
* Generating starting points for MCMC chains
* Forecasting parameter constraints
* Validating MCMC results against Fisher matrix predictions
